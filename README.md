# Data-Science-Industry-Compensation-Analysis

## Introduction

In our Data Science Industry Compensation Analysis, we delve into the “Data Science Salaries 2023” dataset on Kaggle, exploring salary details across the data science and related professions from 2020 to 2023. This comprehensive dataset consists of 3755 rows and 11 columns with no missing values. It provides a wide range of variables including the work year, job titles, level of experience, type of employment, employee’s country of residence, the amount of work done remotely, salary amount paid, salary currency, company location, and size. We chose this dataset because it perfectly aligns with our career aspirations in data science and analytics, offering tailored and valuable insights relevant to our field. Sourced from aijobs.net, a reputable platform focusing on AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science jobs, this dataset ensures quality and reliability.

## Driving Questions

The driving questions for our analysis are:
1. What are the key elements that influence the variation in salaries for professionals in the data science and related fields in 2023?
2. Can we predict or analyze salary trends based on these attributes for 2024?

The goal of our project is to extract insights and actionable recommendations, empowering us to make better career decisions. By analyzing the dataset, we aim to uncover the variables, patterns, and trends that drive the salary components in this fast-evolving data field.

## Data Set

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/data-science-job-salaries) and consists of 11 columns representing various characteristics of the job roles and salaries in the data science industry.

### Features and Their Meanings

Each row in the dataset represents a job entry, and each column contains an attribute or feature of the job. The dataset includes the following columns:

1. `work_year`: The year of the data (e.g., 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023).
2. `job_title`: The job title of the employee (e.g., Data Scientist, Data Engineer).
3. `experience_level`: The experience level in the job (e.g., EN=Entry-level, MI=Mid-level, SE=Senior-level, EX=Executive-level).
4. `employment_type`: The type of employment (e.g., PT=Part-time, FT=Full-time, CT=Contract, FL=Freelance).
5. `employee_residence`: The country of residence of the employee.
6. `remote_ratio`: The amount of work done remotely (e.g., 0=No remote work, 50=Partial remote work, 100=Fully remote work).
7. `company_location`: The country where the employer is located.
8. `company_size`: The size of the company in terms of number of employees (e.g., S=Small, M=Medium, L=Large).
9. `salary_in_usd`: The salary paid to the employee in USD.
10. `salary_currency`: The currency of the salary paid.
11. `company_size`: The size of the company in terms of number of employees (e.g., S=Small, M=Medium, L=Large).

## Analysis

The goal of the analysis is to identify the relationship between job characteristics and salaries. This involves:
- Data Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Building
- Model Evaluation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the project, you will need the following libraries:
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

### Running the Project

1. Prepare the dataset by downloading it from Kaggle and placing it in the `data` directory.
2. Run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts provided in the repository to preprocess the data, perform EDA, and build the predictive model.

## Results

The model evaluation results and performance metrics will be documented in the analysis notebooks and reports.
